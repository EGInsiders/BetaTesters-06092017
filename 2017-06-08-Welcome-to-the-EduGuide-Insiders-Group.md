Welcome to the EduGuide Insiders Group

Thank you everyone for volunteering to help with the testing of the EduGuide website. My name is Jon Morgan, and I am the Web Services Manager for EduGuide. I'll be contacting you from time to time with testing exercises and requests for feedback on new features. If you have any questions or concerns along the way, I can be reached at jon@eduguide.org.

I am trying a new approach with user testing, so if you do have questions or suggestions for ways I can improve my approach, please don't hesitate to contact me at the email above. We want to learn from our testing, and I also want to learn more about the best way to conduct the testing.

As a next step, please join the EduGuide Insiders Community on Google+ ([https://plus.google.com/b/102906894756847084014/communities/107310603151482085733](https://plus.google.com/b/102906894756847084014/communities/107310603151482085733)) I'll be posting updates on upcoming features and testing exercises inside the community. This is also an excellent way to ask questions or share feedback about the website, and interact with other testers. The community contains a link to the Trello board where I'll be posting exercises and the testing blog. You will need to be a member of the Trello board before you can read the instructions in the test exercises. This link will allow you to join the board: [https://trello.com/invite/b/3CF4rGh2/2ba6699b4215b2ff7bc3dfef70ab4399/user-testing-group](https://trello.com/invite/b/3CF4rGh2/2ba6699b4215b2ff7bc3dfef70ab4399/user-testing-group)

Stay tuned for more updates in the Google Community in the near future. Again, feel free to contact me at jon@eduguide.org if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,

Jon Morgan

Web Services Manager
