# Help us Catch the Catch-22s

This week I received an unpleasant surprise when I tried accessing one of the websites that I manage only to to be shown a page which said that the hosting account the website is stored under had been suspended for a terms of service agreement. This was the start of a two day long recovery operation which involved three calls into the hosting company's helpdesk, two chat sessions, a lot of crossed fingers, and some careful trimming of files from the account.

The bottom line is that it was my fault that the account had been suspended. It had amassed too many files and too many database tables. This is something I should have kept a closer eye on. But, my problem with how this happen is that I was never given any advanced warning. Sure, I was inconveniencing the hosting company, but they inconvenienced me when they blocked my ability to access the admin areas for my sites where I could have more easily have been able to find the information I needed in order to clear up the issue.

This was a "catch-22," the type of situation where you don't really have any good options, and while it might be a mess you made, you canâ€™t figure out what it was that you could have done differently to avoid it without changing the circumstances.

When there is a conflict or a violation between two parties, I feel like it is both sides' responsibility to communicate as much of possible. In the case of the hosting, it would have worked out better for me had I been sent an email, or if there was some kind of message in the account which said that I was in violation. Suspension of an account should be the last step, not the first.

While user support was helpful, I was given incomplete direction on how to resolve the issue. The first person I talked to said that I needed to remove the number of files on the account, so I deleted files I didn't need. Once I saw that I was below the limit, I called back to ask that the account be restored, only to be told then that I had too many database tables.

During the next few weeks, I am asking everyone to run through the EduGuide.org and point out any potential "Catch-22" scenarios that could be created on our site. It can be as big as being locked out of an account, or it can be as small as just making a mistake or getting confused by the interface. Some examples of areas you could check out:

* Registering an account

* Resetting a password

* Changing User Settings (Notifications, password reset, etc.)

* Completing a path activity

* Sending a cheer

If you are an active user of the site and have run into a situation where you felt stuck, please make a note of it. Share your feedback inside Slack, or send via email to [helpdesk@eduguide.org](mailto:helpdesk@eduguide.org). If you're not sure where to begin with testing, let me know and I will guide you.
